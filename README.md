# Web Scraping and Data Visualization Project

## Description

This project involves scraping data from two distinct sources: a weather website and the IMDB top 50 movies list, to perform detailed data analysis and visualization. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to extract data from the web, process it using powerful data manipulation libraries, and visually represent the findings using graphs and charts.

## Features

- Data extraction from live websites using Beautiful Soup 4.
- Data cleaning and manipulation with pandas.
- Statistical analysis of scraped data using NumPy.
- Visual representation of data through various charts with Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- **Beautiful Soup 4**: For parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **NumPy**: For high-performance numerical computations.
- **pandas**: For effective data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
